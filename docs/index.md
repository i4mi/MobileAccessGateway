# Mobile Access Gateway

The [Mobile Access Gateway](https://www.mobileaccessgateway.ch/) is an implementation based on the [CH EPR mHealth](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-mhealth/index.html)
implementation guide. It provides a FHIR Gateway supporting the mobile IHE server actors and translates them to the IHE XDS/HL7v3 transactions.

It uses [IPF](https://oehf.github.io/ipf/) and [HAPI-FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/).

You can read more [about the features](features.md), [the endpoints](endpoints.md) or [the changes](changelog.md).
A more complete description of the [transactions needed for the EPR integration of primary systems](integration-primary-system.md)
is also available.
