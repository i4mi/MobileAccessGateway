# development setup

if you are not using the devcontainer from this project with [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension you need to have angular cli and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
ng build --configuration development
```

and then

ng serve --configuration development

## usage

Run `ng serve --configuration development` to start the app, app will be at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/).
If you use the Visual Code functionality with Remote containers: Open Folder in container option, you need to start it with `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0`.

if you use localhost and have cross site blocking issues within chrome start chrome directly from command line (osx)
